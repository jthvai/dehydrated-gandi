Dehydrated Hook for Gandi LiveDNS
=================================

Bash wrapper to create and renew Let's Encrypt SSL certificates using
the https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated[dehydrated] ACME client, the
DNS-01 challenge, and Gandi's LiveDNS API.

Forked from
https://github.com/tchabaud/lets-encrypt-gandi[tchabaud/lets-encrypt-gandi].

This adaptation does not use the `--cron` option of dehydrated, and
instead manually generates certificate requests - for the benefit of my
obsession with elliptical curve keys.

NOTE: This script has only been tested on Arch Linux, though it should
      work on any environment that contains the binaries listed in
      <<dependencies,dependencies>>.
